## Status
Not finished at all.  Lots to do.  First, I'm just putting this on github for
posterity.  I'm planning on porting this to ruby-processing since I hate Java
(sry).  Here's some of the stuff in fail-mode:

  - The people move to the shafts (spawning) but don't get on yet.
  - Car and Door logic is buggy (thus the text on the screen).
  - No brains or floor queue yet.
  - No load or traffic simulation (really the point of this).
